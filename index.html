    <h1>Let's build a DnD character!</h1>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <p>
      Have you ever had trouble coming up with a new Dungeons and Dragons
      character? Do you always play the same type of class and want a change of
      pace? Is coming up with names for the character difficult? Well look no
      further, this app will do the hard work for you! Once you click the
      button, our program will randomly generate a new class AS WELL AS make a
      list of possible names. Hopefully this will make character creation a
      little more easier. On a final note, the amount of names generated is
      based on the amount of hit-die, each class should have! Go give this a try
      and have fun.
