# Project: Complex API 1
## Applying my API fetching skills to a complex API. The APIs that I used were new to me and required a little adjusting.Because they were new to me I was not sure what the json() format was going to be. I was able to use the two APIS synchronously. This is a complex API because I utilized two apis that work with each other to return data back to the user.

## My application is for user who would like to get a GIPH back based on the country of their choosing.The GIPHs correlate with the country that the user inputs. The user can place a country code into the input and a giph associated with that country code will generate.

# How to use:
#### Place country code in the input"
#### Press on the "click me!" button and the giph will poplate.
#### If there is an eror a message will alert on the browser
