# Tech Used: HTML, CSS, Javascript 
This project took HTML, CSS, and Javascript to get the desired result. I chained together 2 different APIs 
in order to get the random pokemon. The PokeAPI and the random number API.
# Lessons Learned
This project gave me a lot of creative freedom in developing a solution. I learned that when calling APIs, the objects at times
can have many different data types for different values. This allowed for me to come up with an idea for a quick application
that would give you random pokemon on a button click.
