## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I passed an api through another api to get specfic inforamtion from the second api. By using a fetch function I was able to grab data from the first api to get parameters that I could use to put into the parameters of the second api.

## Lessons Learned:

I didn't know until this project that you could pass some info from one api into another to run simultanously. Also you need to find the api's documentation to find what parameters the api takes and to find the api key if the api even takes one.
