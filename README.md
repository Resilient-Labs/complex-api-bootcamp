# ðŸ“Š Project: Complex API 

### Goal: Use data returned from one api to make a request to another api and display the data returned

This web app lists the top 50 artists in any given country.

## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs.
When the user submits a country code, the web app runs that input through a travel advisory API, which then runs the corresponding country name from that fetch's response data through another API.  The app then abstracts the top 50 artists from that country (according to the last.fm / audioscrobbler API's perhaps questionable response data), and displays them in an ordered list.

## How To Use:
  1. Click on the link above.
  2. Enter a country code and click the "submit" button.  The "country code" link can help you find any country's code, should you need     help.
  3. Scroll to view that country's list.
  
Enjoy!
