# Covid and Colleges API 

<a href="https://kellychhe-complex-college-covid-api.netlify.app/">This website</a> gives a list of United States colleges and shows what the covid stats are for that state.

## Languages Used

This was created using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. 

The university API I used had interesting formatting where all of the state information was not written the same way. Some used the two letter abbreviation while others had the entire state name. I built a function to standardize the state names to use as query parameters for the covid API. I appeneded the neccessary information to the DOM.

## Lessons Learned

For this project, I learned how finicky online APIs could be. It took forever to find two unrelated APIs that would work together. I finally found a covid API that had good state statistics and everything I needed. However, at the end of the night I tried to fetch information from the API and there was nothing there. All of the information in the API was gone. I had to spend a lot of time looking for another API that would work for this project, but I learned the hard way to not put all my eggs in one basket.
