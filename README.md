<h1 align="center"> NASA Pic of the day API </h1>
<p align="center"> This project uses a pokemon API that lets the user enter the name of any pokemon. The user will then get a random picture of the pokemon. A second api was added which would flip  a pokemon card of the same pokemon and have the picture/info display in the DOM.</p>
