Ron Swanson Quotes and Gifs

How It's Made:

This project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The project was optimized for simplicity and a fun user experience. The code was structured to handle API requests efficiently and incorporates error handling to gracefully manage situations when no GIF is found for a given quote.

Lessons Learned:
This project allowed me to fix mistakes based on what the API parameters requests. I had to adjust and assure that I was using the correct number of characters to fetch gifs, as well as make sure the display is as efficient as possible by removing items no longer needed on the page.
