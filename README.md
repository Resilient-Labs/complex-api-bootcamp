### Goal: Use data returned from one api to make a request to another api and display the data returned

I wanted to create an app for anime watchers to find a new anime show to watch. also returns a famous quote and character from that show to give some insight on what it is about.

### How it was made

so the goal here was to take one api and make it request information for another api. When you click on generate it returns a anime quote from a character, then when you get the name of the anime it pulls a request to another api that displays the cover art, synopsis, and date aired.
