The project that I created generates random Pokemon gifs.

### How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
I searched for two api's that could be interlated. I then took data from the first API and created varibles to run within the second API.




### Lessons Learned:
This project taught me how to properly nest a fetch. I also learned that you can reference multiple varibles within the fetch.
