## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, Javascript

To make this API based website we are going to be using Javascript and fetch syntax to work with the API interfaces.

what the first API does:
get a random breed
get information of that random breed
get an image of the random breed

what the second API does:
collects random breed from first API and be able to look up if that breed is available for adoption
plugging in breed to the fetch url to give me object data for that specific breed.
be able to grab adoption organization data and insert into HTML



## Optimizations


## Lessons Learned:

A great takeaway for this project would be using for loops to deal with the parsed JSON data. using a for loop you can grab specific values, assign them to variables, and use them as parameters in other API interfaces.
