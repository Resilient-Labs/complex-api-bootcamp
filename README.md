# ðŸ“Š Project: Complex API 

### Goal: Use data returned from one api to make a request to another api and display the data returned

For this complex API project I used a random word generator api to present a word. That displayed word's value was then input into a second nested API that then provided the definition of that word.

I used HTML, CSS, API documentation, and JavaScript to complete this project.

### Lessons Learned :

- I learned to not overcomplicate my code and find simpler solutions that provide the same result. At first I had set it up where new elements would appear in the DOM but I found that having existing elements in HTML update was a much better solution, at least for this project's purpose.
- This project was the one that really solidified my understanding of APIs and pulling information from them. It boosted my confidence for sure.
