# ðŸ“Š Project: Complex API 

### Goal: Use data returned from one api to make a request to another api and display the data returned

### Process:

<ol>
  <li>I'm not even kidding when I say that this took my 18 hours to do.</li>
  <li>The HTML and CSS was so pretty, I reminded me of Tumblr. It really made my high school heart melt.</li>
  <li>The JavaScript.</li>
   <li><em>The JavaScript...</em></li>
  <li><strong>The JavaScript.</li>
  <li>The hardest thing I've done in this cohort to date (but who know? Maybe next week will be 10x worse.)</li>
  <li>Originally, I wanted for the user to be able to click on the emoji, receive a bio for their chosen artist, and then have AI generate an image that would be predicted to be that artist's next album.</li>
  <li>El-oh-el.  Wishful thinking, baby boo.  The way I could not get Open AI to grant me access.  I spent maybe four hours at a time working the API because I wanted the original idea so bad.</li>
  <li>The idea then shifted to having a group of the artist's similar artist <em>jump</em> the user.  Man, oh man.</li>
  <li>I settled on the mood board because it was the easiest to process the API.</li> 

<p>Overall, I am SUPER AMAZED.  This is something that I'm definitely going to pt on my portfolio.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I completed the challenge: | 5 <em>It's done and done well!  Bravo, me!</em></li>
  <li>I feel good about my code: | 5 <em>Solid code, solid execution.</em></li>
</ul>
