# ðŸ“Š Project: Complex API 

### Goal: Use data returned from one api to make a request to another api and display the data returned

In this project I used two web APIs to display in the DOM. I specifically used a Game of Thrones Character API and TV Show Quotes API to make this work.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Web APIs

Both APIs work together to make a request and return the character name, image and quote in the DOM. 

## Lessons Learned:

This was another API project where I ran into issues finding two APIs that would work together, and that were actually functioning.
