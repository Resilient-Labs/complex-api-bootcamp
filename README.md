## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The project was create and designed with HTML and CSS. Javascript was used to fetch an API that generates the concert dates found in ticketmaster based on the parameter of artist.  The venue data from the API is then used with the Wiki API to provide additional information on the venue.

## Optimizations (Optional):

Optional.


## Lessons Learned:

I learned that APIs range in terms of their functionality, and that being able to leverage the functionality of the API is important in terms of the information you receive back. APIs may often provide more information than is needed to address your particuar quesitons or objectve for your project. It is important to only utilize relevant data, in this case only the first concert. The api had a built in sort/filter by date which was helpful.  I also learned the utility of using null to reset appended/populated files with empty or no values.
