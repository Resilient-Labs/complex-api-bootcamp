# Covid-19 Complex API 

A COVID-19 Stats Tracker Application. This app includes the ability for a user see the current COVID-19 stats - vaccinated, total cases, total deaths, recovered cases, and active cases are all included. Users also have the ability to get more news, find a covid testing site, and find vaccine testing!

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, API

This project involved using APIS and learning how to set them up so that data returned from one API can make a request to another api and display that data. The Covid-19 app takes the country USA and uses the location to display the current status of some covid-19 statistics.

## Optimizations

Potentially finding improved API's - this one was more difficult to find for vaccine statistics. 

## Reflections:

This was cool to build out - the API's were definitely harder to work with, but I enjoyed displaying real-world statistics. The CSS is something I'm hoping to update in the future.
