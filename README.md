# My To do list
This project is a complex API. I used the New York Times API along with a Giphy API. I was able to utilize the names of any person for both APIs to work together, so when you input a name(last name, first name) it will give you a gif of that person that you've searched for. Keep in mind that not everyone will show up, only those who have been on an article for The New York Times.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I created a wireframe for the complex API with an input and a button. I used CSS to margin the input and button to center them. Next I used JavaScript to create the behavior with the button and the input. 

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that you should find 2 APIs that share a similar property so that it makes linking those APIs easier.
